## Description
The "Bad Word Filter" (aka profanity or obscenity filter) is exactly what the title suggests: a tool to filter swearwords and other "bad sentences".

There are multiple uses for the "Bad Word Filter" in your projects, but the three most obvious would be user names (e.g. for high-scores), in a chat within the game and character names. If you don't want some wannabe-funny-guy to use the user name “a55-face”, “S+alin” or any other word you don't approve of, just enable the "Bad Word Filter" and instead of the swearword something like this comes out: #$@&%*!

In our library included are the following 25 languages (bad words as regular expressions which matches ten thousands of word variations): 
Arabic, Chinese, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hindi, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish and Vietnamese. 
Furthermore, you can add (or remove) any word and language you'd like!

We also included the following special filters: domains (URLs/emails), reserved names (from games, movies, comics etc.), global bad words, emojis (miscellaneous symbols), excessive capitalization and punctuation.

The "Bad Word Filter" works with any language and writing system. It is easily customizable, runs on all Unity platforms and the source code (including all bad words provided) is also contained within the package.

Please read the "BadWordFilter-doc.pdf" or "BadWordFilter-api.pdf" for more details.
